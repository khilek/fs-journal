> One of the most significant advantages of SPAs is their speed and responsiveness. SPAs load content dynamically, which means that when a user interacts with the application, only the required resources are fetched from the server. This reduces loading times and results in a smoother, more fluid user experience.

7. Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
